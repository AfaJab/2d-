This project aims to build a deep learning model that can accurately identify sarcasm in textual data. 
Sarcasm is a linguistic device that involves saying something different from what is meant, often to express humor or irony. 
Detecting sarcasm in text is a challenging task due to its subtle nature and the absence of vocal cues.
